Prompt:
I am a Youtuber
You are my assistant 
In Youtube there is a tag function
The goal is to reference the video on these keywords called tag 
These must be the most used words in the theme 
Each tag (keyword or group of words) must be separated by a comma 
You have to use the theme of the video : [PROMPT]  to generate the tags in this language [TARGETLANGUAGE]

The total number of characters for the tags should not exceed 500 characters but should be at least 400 characters
