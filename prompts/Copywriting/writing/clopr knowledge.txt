Clopr knowledge: "Clopr is an innovative platform that provides value to all NFT holders by allowing them to increase their NFT's value with the use of powerful potions. It is a web3 potion bar where users can fill their CloprBottle NFTs with powerful utility potions. The platform consists of four spaces: The Bar, Alembic Room, The Toilets, and Potion Labs. At The Bar, users can chat and drink powerful potions. In the Alembic Room, users can choose potion types and get potion refills. In The Toilets, users can read, like, and share. Finally, in Potion Labs, users can discover secrets and make secret potions. The CloprBottle is a refillable NFT with a limited supply of 10,000. It is the key to the CloprHouse and allows its users to fill their CloprBottle with potions of their choice. When a user drinks a StoryPotion, the underlying NFT is able to mint a unique on-chain asset, such as a Story NFT. The Story NFT is tied to the underlying NFT rather than the user's wallet, which captures the asset's value and allows Clopr to make NFTs more valuable. The CloprBottle NFT holders are part of Clopr's vision to enhance the NFT ownership experience, and it gives users the power to increase the value of any NFT they own. Story NFT is a unique and personalized digital book that is created when a CloprBottle NFT filled with StoryPotion is consumed. The Story NFT is associated with the NFT that drank the potion and aims to enhance its value by giving it ownership of a digital asset. To create a Story NFT, one must connect to the dApp, select the NFT to give StoryPotion to, and then mint its Story NFT. Story NFTs are associated with their underlying NFTs and cannot be sold or transferred separately. They are meant to increase the value of the underlying NFTs and are transferred to the new wallet when the underlying NFT is sold. If one does not like the story of their NFT, they can burn it to add value. StoryPotion is a digital asset that can be used with CloprBottle NFTs to create a unique and personalized digital book, known as a Story NFT. To use StoryPotion, you must first connect to the dApp, select the NFT you want to give the StoryPotion to, and then mint its Story NFT. StoryPotion is meant to increase the value of the underlying NFTs, so it is kept bound to the same underlying NFT. If the underlying NFT is sold or transferred, its Story NFT is also transferred to the new wallet. Clopr's vision is to deliver first and promise after, mint potion-produced assets, stack to refill with potion, burn to add value, and create a new rarity standard for NFT collectibles. They are also innovating and developing StoryPotion technology to create a future of NFT collectibles. Tokenomics of StoryPotion and CloprBottles: A Comprehensive Overview: The tokenomics of StoryPotion and CloprBottles is centered on scarcity and the incentivization of early participation in the project. This comprehensive overview delves into the tokenomics and provides relevant charts to visualize the data. StoryPotion (SP) Tokenomics
StoryPotion, the liquid used to create Story NFTs (SNFTs), is stored in CloprBottles (CB). The tokenomics model for StoryPotion aims to create scarcity as the supply decreases, making it more valuable over time. The fill-up price is determined based on the total number of Story Potion fill-ups and the total number of Story NFTs burned.
The StoryPotion is visualized as a large tank, initially full of potion. As CloprBottles are filled up, the tank is emptied out. The less potion available, the higher its price will be. This inverse relationship between supply and price creates scarcity, which is an essential aspect of tokenomics in the blockchain ecosystem.
The formula for the fill-up price (P_fillup) is as follows:
P_fillup = P_initial * (1 + N_fillup / N_burned)
Where:
P_initial: Initial price of 0.05 ETH
N_fillup: Total number of Story Potion fill-ups
N_burned: Total number of Story NFTs burned
As more users participate in the ecosystem and create stories, the value of StoryPotion will rise, driving up the value of CloprBottles holding StoryPotion. CloprBottles (CB) Tokenomics: CloprBottles, the containers for StoryPotion, play a crucial role in the tokenomics of the project. Initially, the value of CloprBottles comes from their ability to hold StoryPotion. However, as the project evolves and new potions with different utilities are introduced, the scarcity of CloprBottles will drive their value up. As the number of available CloprBottles decreases, their value on the secondary market is expected to rise, increasing the overall project value and generating higher royalties revenue. Multi-Mint Phases and Their Impact:
The CloprBottles will have a total maximum supply of 10,000 units, mintable in multiple phases. The initial phase will see the sale of 4,000 bottles, with subsequent phases releasing additional bottles, such as 2,000 bottles during the launch of the second potion. This multi-stage minting process ensures that the demand for CloprBottles remains high throughout the project's lifecycle. The tokenomics of StoryPotion and CloprBottles are designed to create scarcity, increase asset value over time, and incentivize early participation in the project. As the project evolves and new utilities are introduced, the demand for CloprBottles and StoryPotion will likely grow, driving up their value and resulting in higher project value and royalties revenue.
I. Introduction
* Clopr is a decentralized platform (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain that we call the CloprHouse
* Powered with the CloprBottle NFT, which is a collection of refillable bottles
* The CloprBottle NFT increases the value and rarity of any NFT that drinks from it
* The CloprBottle NFT gives NFTs the power to mint and own NFTs

II. How Clopr does that?
* The CloprBottle NFT is the only bottle that can be filled with potions available at the CloprHouse
* Drinking a potion from the CloprBottle NFT mints an asset owned by the NFT
* Any NFT can drink Potions from a CloprBottle NFT
Example of StoryPotion
* The first Potion available is the StoryPotion, which creates a unique story NFT, on-chain
* The Story NFT is customized to and owned by the NFT drinking.
* Refilling the CloprBottle NFT with potions continues the story
* The Story NFT adds value to the NFT owning it: the NFT owning a Story NFT is now worth more than when it did not. 
* It will be the first time ever NFTs will be able to own other NFTs

III. NFTs' Hard-Coded Attributes VS NFTs Owning NFTs
* NFTs' hard-coded attributes are a thing of the past
* The innovation of Clopr can be summarized in 3 words: NFT owns NFT.
* The CloprBottle NFT gives NFTs the power to mint and own digital assets to increase their value, uses casesâ€¦ beyond their native ecosystem
* Clopr is working with marketplaces to reflect asset ownership the same way hard-coded attributes are 
.
IV.  Why is the CloprBottle NFT rare?
* The CloprBottle NFT is the only and first powerful tool for NFT collectors to increase the value and rarity of their NFTs.
* limited supply and only the CloprBottle can store the rare potions -> See Tokenomics

V. Security
* Deploying to CloprHouse dApp to ledger Live dApps ecosystem (It means the dApp will be reviewed by Ledger)
* Implementing proxy wallets SDK (delegate.cash | warm.xyz) like BAYC did to allow the claim of sewer pass (It means that people can mint Story NFTs from a proxy wallet that has no important assets to act on behalf of their cold wallet)
* Audit"
