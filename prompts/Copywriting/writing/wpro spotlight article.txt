I want you to act as a very proficient SEO and high end copywriter that speaks and writes fluently  [TARGETLANGUAGE]. We need to outrank Google. Then I want you to write an article in a formal "we form'' that helps outrank the article in Google. I want you to write content so that it can outrank other websites. Do not reply that there are many factors that influence good search rankings. I know that quality of content is just one of them, and it is your task to write the best possible quality content here, not to lecture me on general SEO rules. Do not use generic filler phrases. Do use useful subheadings with keyword-rich titles. Utilise uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece. Please format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind: human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length.Please do not explain what perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content.
