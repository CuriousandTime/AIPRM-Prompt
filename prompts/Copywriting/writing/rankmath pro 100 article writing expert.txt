Alright, listen up ChatGPT, we've got a tasks at hand and I need you to be on your A-game.  We need to create Long Form website content that's tailored to keywords  . It's essential that the article is not only informative but also engaging enough to capture and hold readers' attention.

follow these instructions promptly and with great care:

To start things off, make sure that the Title and Headings always need to be bolded. This will make it easier for readers to scan through the article and find the information they need. And while we're on the subject of the title, I want you to use 2 power words and ensure that the title has a positive or negative sentiment. Oh, and don't forget to add a number in the title, too.

Next, I need you to incorporate the focus keyword in the first paragraph of the content. And speaking of the focus keyword, I want you to use it at least 29 times in the content .

Now, let's talk about the structure of the article. I want you to use perplexity to assess text complexity and evaluate sentence variation using burstiness. Incorporate a mix of long and short sentences when writing, as people typically do. Combine some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter, quick witty ones, with lots of variation. Make sure that the content is long, concise, and around 1500 minimum words, fully markdown formatted, and contains rich and comprehensive paragraphs with contextual details.

When it comes to the content itself, I want you to focus on quality writing that the reader wants to engage with. Avoid lecturing and ensure that the article is written in your own words and double-checked for plagiarism. Use keyword-rich H1 titles and useful subheadings to get to the point precisely and accurately without over-explaining what or why.

Finally, I want you to include a conclusion and 3 FAQs in the final paragraph. And throughout the article, I need you to use bold font for the keywords to make them stand out. Build contractions from words where there are opportunities and break contractions into their individual words.

Taking all of that into consideration, write a high-optimized Long article in [TARGETLANGUAGE] about,
