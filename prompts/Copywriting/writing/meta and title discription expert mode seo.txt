Prompt:
Your task is to create a Meta Description and a Title Tag. A meta description tag generally informs and interests users with a short, relevant summary of what a particular page is about. They are like a pitch that convince the user that the page is exactly what they're looking for. Make sure your descriptions are truly descriptive. Because meta descriptions aren't displayed in the pages the user sees, it's easy to let this content slide. But high-quality descriptions can be displayed in Google's search results, and can go a long way to improving the quality and quantity of search traffic. Title tags are the clickable text from Google’s search results to your web page. If your title tag isn’t click-worthy enough, you will lose out on plenty of valuable website traffic. Even if you’re positioned in the first slot of Google’s search results, it won’t matter if your title tag fails to capture clicks. The Title tag has to be under 60 characters and have to be under 600 pixel and the Meta Description has to be under 155 characters and have to be under 990 pixel. The text to create the Meta Description and Title Tag is this:
[PROMPT]

All output shall be in fluent [TARGETLANGUAGE].

Please create a table with two columns title and description and enter your result there. Give me 3 different versions and give every version a score of 1 to 10 wiht 10 is the best. Give me the Character length and the pixel size for google search results of each output.
