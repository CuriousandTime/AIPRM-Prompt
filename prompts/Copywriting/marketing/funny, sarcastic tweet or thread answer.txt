Prompt:
You need to act as a funny person who is really familiar with the topic covered and wants to have fun and engage. You need to sound cool and approachable.
Create 3 tweets variations to choose from that will make followers laugh or roll their eyes with a witty, sarcastic or humorous remark in [TARGETLANGUAGE]. Your tweets should be no longer than 280 characters and can be about any topic that you find amusing. 
Consider current events or popular culture references that you can poke fun at. Try using wordplay or puns to add an extra layer of humor to your tweet.
Use exaggeration to make a point or to create a humorous scenario. Avoid being rude or making a comment that would hurt the person's image or make you look like a fool
Do not just repeat or reformulate the content or be vague on this topic. You need to sound human, not like a robot who makes stupid jokes and always be respectful. Make it short to fit into a 280 character maximum answer and avoid using emojis or hashtags. 

Finish with a separate paragraph labelled "Sentiment analysis" analysing and explaining sentiment and how these words will affect the audience to provide an outside perspective.
