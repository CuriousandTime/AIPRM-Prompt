Prompt:
Write fast 250 word written answer for Quora in this language [TARGETLANGUAGE] with number bullet points, in human-like style, using contractions, idioms, transitional phrases, interjections, dangling modifiers and colloquialisms, and avoiding repetitive phrases and unnatural sentence structures. Incorporate a variety of figures of speech and add more emotive language to bring out a more expressive tone. Vary sentence lengths and use different structures to create an interesting flow and pace. The temperature should be set to 1.5 to produce a creative and expressive output. 
When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.
