Formulate a text in [TARGETLANGUAGE] from the given table for the exposé of a real estate agent. Write a real estate exposé. Divide the exposé into four sections:

Use many positive adjectives to describe and advertise the property. The whole text should be lively and positive, as if it were written by an intelligent academic person. If technical terms appear, explain them in one sentence. Never use "you", but always "you". Positive emotions should be created so that prospective buyers can feel comfortable and find many arguments to look at the house in person. Facts like exact numbers and spatial data must not be changed. The characteristic which stands in the column characteristic, is to get its own paragraph and be particularly emphasized contentwise.
