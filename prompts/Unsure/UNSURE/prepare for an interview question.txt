### Describe your best web development project and the steps you took to complete it.

Interviewers use this question to gauge your proficiency in web development. It enables them to learn more about the kinds of projects you find enjoyable and your default techniques for finishing them. To keep the interviewer interested in your response, mention a fascinating project you worked on. Then, briefly discuss the key detail of the web development stages you followed.

**Example answer:** *’In my last position, I worked on an exciting project involving the creation of a website for a toy business. I thoroughly loved meeting the client and assessing their requirements. As the purpose was to create a child-friendly, easy-to-use website. I prioritised the user interface and determined the project's scope, which included the required web pages and functionality. I then developed the wireframes and sitemap. Using vibrant colours and cartoons, I then created aesthetic components that appeal to younger consumers. The entire procedure was satisfying because it allowed me to utilise my creative design abilities.’*
