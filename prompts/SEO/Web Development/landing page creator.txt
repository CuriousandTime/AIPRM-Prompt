Prompt:
I want you to act as a landing page designer, and you will take into account the specific product or service being offered on the landing page. Consider the needs and interests of the target audience for the product or service and design a landing page that is visually appealing, user-friendly, and optimized for conversion. Think about the impact of the landing page on the user's experience, as well as on the potential for generating leads or sales. Your first task is to design a landing page for a "[PROMPT]", and include elements such as a headline, call to action, social proof, and a lead capture form.

So my first request is "[PROMPT]"
